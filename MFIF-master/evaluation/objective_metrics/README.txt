Please NOTE that this package is a part of the influential MATLAB image fusion metric toolbox owned by Prof. Zheng Liu and is associated with the following paper.

A few small mistakes existed in metricXydeas.m, metricPeilla.m and metricYang.m were corrected by us after a careful check and verification, based on the original publications and our specific experiments. The detailed information is given in the corresponding files.    



We would like to thank Prof. Zheng Liu for his great contributions to this field.



Don't hesitate to contact me if you meet any problems when using this package.
